# Documentation - https://typicode.github.io/husky/
# Repository    - https://github.com/typicode/husky
# Version       - 9.0.11

# To upgrade the husky version:
#
# 1. Run the following commands:
#
#    ```sh
#    npm install --save-dev --save-exact husky@latest
#    npx husky init
#    npm run init
#    ```
#
# 2. Compare the Git diffs between the following files and incorporate the changes from the former into the latter:
#
#    | Former              | Latter                 |
#    | :------------------ | :--------------------- |
#    | .husky/_/h          | .githooks/_/husky.sh   |
#    | .husky/_/commit-msg | .githooks/_/commit-msg |
#    | .husky/_/pre-commit | .githooks/_/pre-commit |
#    | .husky/_/pre-push   | .githooks/_/pre-push   |
#
# 3. Delete the .husky/ directory.
#
# 4. Commit the changes to the files in the .githooks/ directory.

# If the $HUSKY environment variable is set to 2 then make the shell
# print the commands (and their arguments) as they're executed.
