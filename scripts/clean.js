//   just from importing the function in its associated unit test file.
// - The conditional logic below ensures that `clean` is only called by the `npm run clean` command.
// - Exclude the following lines from the test coverage report since it's difficult
//   to mock the value of this environment variable since it's outside of `clean`.
